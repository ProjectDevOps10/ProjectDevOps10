# Fix GitHub Pages README Issue

The GitHub Pages is currently deploying the README.md instead of your frontend app.

## Solution:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/ProjectDevOps10/iAgent

2. **Click on "Settings" tab**

3. **Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar**

4. **Under "Build and deployment", change the Source from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"**

5. **Save the changes**

This will:
- Stop deploying the README.md 
- Allow the `frontend-deploy.yml` workflow to properly deploy your React app
- Your frontend will be available at: https://ProjectDevOps10.github.io/iAgent

## What was happening:
- GitHub Pages was set to deploy from the `main` branch root directory
- This shows the README.md file as the website
- We need it to use GitHub Actions instead to deploy the built frontend app

## After the fix:
- The `frontend-deploy.yml` workflow will deploy your actual React frontend
- The site will show your chatbot app, not the README
